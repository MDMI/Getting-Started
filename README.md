# Welcome to MDMI on GitHub
## Message Transformation Service for Healthcare
The MDMI Project goals are to lower the barriers for implementing healthcare transformations using open standards and open source software. The MDMI Project uses a model driven approach that is compliant with the Object Management Groupâ€™s open standard of Model Driven Message Interoperability (MDMI). Visit [OMG.org](https://www.omg.org/spec/MDMI/1.0) for more information.

## Hands-on with MDMI Transformations
The components of MDMI message transformations have been provided here on GitHub as well as staged online for immediate use. They include the following:

### Swagger API
An online Swagger implementation is available allowing you to see the structure of the API. Instructions for its use are [here](
https://github.com/MDMI/MDMI-Transformation-Engine/wiki/MDMI-Message-Transformations-Using-Swagger). You can go directly to the site at this URL:  
http://ec2-3-16-40-203.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8080/swagger-ui/index.html?url=/v3/api-docs&validatorUrl=#/mdmi-engine/transformation

Please click [here](https://github.com/MDMI/MDMI-Transformation-Engine/wiki/Connectathon) for test messages and a dedicated Swagger implementation.

### Docker Implementation
A Docker image is available to run the application locally - the best option to examine with your own messages. To get the Docker image enter the commands:

*docker pull mdmiservices/cda2fhir*  

Then:

*docker run --name cda2fhir -d -p 5000:8080 mdmiservices/cda2fhir*

A Swagger implementation is accessed at [http://localhost:5000/swagger-ui/index.html?url=/v3/api-docs&validatorUrl=#/mdmi-engine/transformation](http://localhost:5000/swagger-ui/index.html?url=/v3/api-docs&validatorUrl=#/mdmi-engine/transformation)

## MDMI Map Repository
MDMI Maps are MDMI models for a specific healthcare exchange standard. The models are reusable, consumable and computable assets. MDMI Maps are used by the MDMI Transformation Service to transform a source message to a target message. Maps are easily modified or versioned to address changes and variants to any standard or proprietary exchange format.  
[Click here to see example maps](https://github.com/MDMI/MDMI-Transformation-Engine/tree/main/Maps)

## MDMI Workbench
Transformation maps are created using the MDMI Workbench which is implemented as an Eclipse plugin. Setup instructions are documented in this repository's wiki here:

## Discussions ![Discussions](/files/images/discuss3-160.png)
The place for all discussions regarding MDMI software and maps is in this repository's [Discussion](https://github.com/MDMI/MDMI-Transformation-Engine/discussions) page. Please feel free to ask questions and provide suggestions for the system. The board is monitored.

## Issues ![Issues](/files/images/issues160.png)
Similarly, when you encounter issues with the software or maps, please enter details in the [Issues](https://github.com/MDMI/MDMI-Transformation-Engine/issues) section of this repository. As are the guidelines in all _good_ bug reporting, please provide enough information and file attachments that the problem can be reproduced.
